# Machine_Learning_Assignments
This repository contains my machine learning assignments which were done through semester 9 
These assignments were done in pairs

## Assignment 1 (Polynomial Regression Assignment)

The objective of this assignment is to apply polynomial regression on the provided data using 3 regularization techniques

### Steps Done:

- Cleaned the data
- Applied Feature scale 
- Evaluated different degrees of lasso CV polynomial regression
- Evaluated different degrees of Ridge CV polynomial regression.
- Evaluated different degrees of ElasticNet CV polynomial regression.
- Compared the models 

### The Conclusion

We found that the best degree of lasso is the 1st degree, the best degree of ridge is the 6th degree, 
and the best degree of elasticNet is the 4th degree. We also found that the best model for this dataset is the Ridge CV polynomial regression.
